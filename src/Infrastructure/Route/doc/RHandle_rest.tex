%\subsubsection{Restrictions and Future Work}
\begin{itemize}

\item {\bf Non-blocking} communication via the {\tt routesyncflag} option is implemented for Fields and Arrays. It is {\em not} available for FieldBundles and ArrayBundles. The user is advised to use the VMEpoch approach for all cases to achive asynchronicity.

\item The {\bf dynamic masking} feature currently has the following limitations:

\begin{itemize}

\item Only available for {\tt ESMF\_TYPEKIND\_R8} and {\tt ESMF\_TYPEKIND\_R4} Fields and Arrays.

\item Only available through the {\tt ESMF\_FieldRegrid()} and {\tt ESMF\_ArraySMM()} methods.

\item Destination objects that have undistributed dimensions {\em after} any distributed dimension are not supported.

\item No check is implemented that ensure the user-provided RouteHandle object is suitable for dynamic masking.

\end{itemize}


\end{itemize}
