The main product delivered by ESMF is the ESMF library that allows application
developers to write programs based on the ESMF API. In addition to the 
programming library, ESMF distributions come with a small set of command line
tools (CLT) that are of general interest to the community. These CLTs utilize
the ESMF library to implement features such as printing general information
about the ESMF installation, or generating regrid weight files. The provided
ESMF CLTs are intended to be used as standard command line tools.

The bundled ESMF CLTs are built and installed during the usual ESMF 
installation process, which is described in detail in the ESMF User's Guide 
section "Building and Installing the ESMF". After installation, the
CLTs will be located in the {\tt ESMF\_APPSDIR} directory, which can 
be found as a Makefile variable in the {\tt esmf.mk} file. The {\tt esmf.mk} 
file can be found in the {\tt ESMF\_INSTALL\_LIBDIR} directory after a 
successful installation.  The ESMF User's Guide discusses the {\tt esmf.mk} 
mechanism to access the bundled CLTs in more detail in section 
"Using Bundled ESMF Command Line Tools".

The following sections provide in-depth documentation of the bundled ESMF 
CLTs. In addition, each tool supports the standard 
\verb+ --help + command line argument, providing a brief description of how 
to invoke the program.
