\section{Appendix A: Master List of Constants}
\label{const:cmaster}

\subsection{ESMC\_CALKIND}
This flag is documented in section \ref{const:calkindflag_c}.

\subsection{ESMC\_COORDSYS}
This flag is documented in section \ref{const:ccoordsys}.

\subsection{ESMC\_DECOMP}
\label{const:cdecompflag}
{\sf DESCRIPTION:\\}
Indicates how DistGrid elements are decomposed over DEs.

The type of this flag is:

{\tt type(ESMC\_Decomp\_Flag)}

The valid values are:
\begin{description}
\item [ESMC\_DECOMP\_BALANCED]
      Decompose elements as balanced as possible across DEs. The maximum 
      difference in number of elements per DE is 1, with the extra elements on
      the lower DEs.
\item [ESMC\_DECOMP\_CYCLIC]
      Decompose elements cyclically across DEs.
\item [ESMC\_DECOMP\_RESTFIRST]
      Divide elements over DEs. Assign the rest of this division to the first
      DE.
\item [ESMC\_DECOMP\_RESTLAST]
      Divide elements over DEs. Assign the rest of this division to the last DE.
\item [ESMC\_DECOMP\_SYMMEDGEMAX]
      Decompose elements across the DEs in a symmetric fashion. Start with the
      maximum number of elements at the two edge DEs, and assign a decending
      number of elements to the DEs as the center of the decomposition is 
      approached from both sides.
\end{description}

{\tt subsection(ESMC\_ExtrapMethod\_Flag)}
\label{opt:cextrapmethod}
{\sf DESCRIPTION:\\}
Specify which extrapolation method to use on unmapped destination points after 
regridding.

The type of this flag is:

{\tt type(ESMC\_ExtrapMethod\_Flag)}

The valid values are:
\begin{description}
\item [ESMC\_EXTRAPMETHOD\_NONE]
      Indicates that no extrapolation should be done. 
\item [ESMC\_EXTRAPMETHOD\_NEAREST\_STOD]
      Inverse distance weighted average. 
      Here the value of a destination point is the weighted average of the 
      closest N source points. The weight is the reciprocal of the distance of 
      the source point from the destination point raised to a power P. All the
      weights contributing to one destination point are normalized so that they 
      sum to 1.0. The user can choose N and P when using this method, but 
      defaults are also provided.  
\item [ESMC\_EXTRAPMETHOD\_NEAREST\_IDAVG]
      Nearest source to destination. 
      Here each destination point is mapped to the closest source point. A given 
      source point may go to multiple destination points, but no destination 
      point will receive input from more than one source point. 
\end{description}

\subsection{ESMC\_FILEFORMAT}
This flag is documented in section \ref{const:cfileformat}.

{\tt subsection(ESMC\_FileMode\_Flag)}

\item [ESMC\_INDEX\_DELOCAL]
      Indicates that DE-local index space starts at lower bound 1 for each DE.
\item [ESMC\_INDEX\_GLOBAL]
      Indicates that global indices are used. This means that DE-local index
      space starts at the global lower bound for each DE.
\item [ESMC\_INDEX\_USER]
      Indicates that the DE-local index bounds are explicitly set by the user.
\end{description}

\subsection{ESMC\_LINETYPE}
\label{opt:lineType}

{\sf DESCRIPTION:\\}  This argument allows the user to select the path of the 
line which connects two points on the surface of a sphere.
This in turn controls the path along which distances are calculated and the 
shape of the edges that make up a cell.

The type of this flag is:

{\tt type(ESMC\_LineType\_Flag)}

The valid values are:
\begin{description}
\item [ESMC\_LINETYPE\_CART]
    Cartesian line. When this option is specified distances are calculated in a 
    straight line through the 3D Cartesian space in which the sphere is 
    embedded. Cells are approximated by 3D planes bounded by 3D Cartesian lines 
    between their corner vertices.
    When calculating regrid weights, this line type is currently the default for 
    the following regrid methods: ESMC\_REGRIDMETHOD\_BILINEAR,
    ESMC\_REGRIDMETHOD\_PATCH, ESMC\_REGRIDMETHOD\_NEAREST\_STOD, and 
    ESMC\_REGRIDMETHOD\_NEAREST\_DTOS.
\item [ESMC\_LINETYPE\_GREAT\_CIRCLE]
    Great circle line. When this option is specified distances are calculated 
    along a great circle path (the shortest distance between two points on a 
    sphere surface). Cells are bounded by great circle paths between their 
    corner vertices. When calculating regrid weights, this line type is 
    currently the default for the following regrid method: 
    ESMC\_REGRIDMETHOD\_CONSERVE.
